Link for the Project Description and Data - https://www.kaggle.com/c/coupon-purchase-prediction

Ponpare released a yearâ€™s worth of data, from 07/01/2011 to 06/30/2012 (except the information related to the very last week i.e. 06/24/2012-06/30/2012, which is kept out for the model evaluation purposes) about the users, visits, purchases, and products of its coupon website. This contains coupon view and purchase logs of 22873 users. In this time period they viewed 32,628 coupons. Of these, attributes of only 19,413 coupons have been provided.
